    <h1>How To Play</h1>
    
    <p>Journey through the galaxy with our action-packed space shooter game. Choose from multiple levels with increasing difficulty to challenge your skills. Are you ready to save the universe?</p>
    <p>The controls are A and D to rotate the ship left and right respectively, E (mouse scroll up) and R (mouse scroll down) can be used to make the ship move up and down. The spacebar must be used in order to shoot the enemies.</p>
    <p>The game is quite simple, the objective is to kill the enemy spaceships and the enemy spacestations in the game world.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above, there are three levels to the game with increasing difficulty as you progress through them.</p>
    <p>The game (level) is won when all the enemy space stations or bases as well as all the already spawned enemy spaceships are eliminated.</p>
    <p>Be careful because the enemy spaceships keep spawning at their respective bases until one destroys the enemy station base</p>
    <p>Enemy spaceships possess the ability to phase through, i.e enemy spaceships explode if they collide with anything except for other enemy spaceships and their own enemy bases</p>
    <p>Make sure to avoid bumping into some things because if you collide with an asteroid, enemy spaceship, enemy bases, planets or moons then you lose the game</p>
    <p>Colliding with earth would mean you chose flight instead of fight and ran away from the fight hence the game would be over</p>
    <p>If you run away from the game area (a certain long distance in any direction) then you lose and the game is over</p>
    <p>Lastly, there are some cool powerups in the game with unique abilities, check them out!</p>
    <p>We hope you enjoy Big Theta's 3D Spaceshooter game, Good Luck!</p>
